# Book_Recommendation
* A simple Book Recommendation System with basic data mining techniques

The Book Crossing Data can be downloaded here: http://guidetodatamining.com/assets/data/BX-Dump.zip

In this project, I will use three different similarity measures to make a recommendation. They are Distance Measures, Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Cosine Similarity.

Thx to the freely available book 'A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining', I learnt many basic data mining techniques from it.
